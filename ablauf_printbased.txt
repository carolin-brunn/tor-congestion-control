4 times initialize TorApp (per node)

4x hintereinander:
    add circuits via TorBaseApp

    2x TorApp add connections

    2x TorApp add active circuits

=> on every socket runs another application
=> write& read bucket are refilled (with callback in background?)
=> bytes are read from Socket.m_leftToRead (ConnWriteCallback??)

Conn und Refill Callback immer im Wechsel
